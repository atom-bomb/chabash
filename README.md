# chabash

here is a simple Markov chain chat bot in bash

chabash makes a weighted graph of individual words and punctuation and stores it in shell environment variables. it can read in text files to build a graph or build a graph from text entered in the console.


there is nothing remotely useful about this program.

```
chabash.sh usage:
-h             : print this help and exit
-v             : verbose output
-d <filename>  : restore and save graph from given filename
-r <filename>  : read text from filename
```
